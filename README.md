# automated-trading
Project to automate trading of stocks

# Overview
I built this project with the intention of automating my investments. I hosted these scripts on Heroku, and ran them on a 5-minute interval daily. It collected my current holdings, sold the stocks that had reached a certain threshold, and bought stocks with the remaining money. In total I have seen returns >10% while using this program, and even when the stock market had been crashing I saw returns that were better than the market averages.  

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Heroku
- SQLite
