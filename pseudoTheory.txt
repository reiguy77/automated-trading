Process:
1.)Get current holdings
2.)Check current stocks to see which ones can be sold
2.)Figure out how much uninvested money there is
3.)Check list of stocks for which ones should not be sold
(once index funds and bonds are included??)
4.)Sell appropriate amount to keep the balance between index funds and bonds(60%/40%)




Idea behind percentage expectations - 
BREAK IT INTO SECTIONS - each period will have a set sale percentage
No day trading(yet)
Within a day, 1% change would be expected
Within three days, ...seems like a 1% change is also expected
Within a week, you no longer want to hold onto this stock, sell once positive
After two weeks sell once within 1% of the initial cost
